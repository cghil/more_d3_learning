#Generators
- D3 generators consist of functions that take data and return the neccessary SVG drawing code to create a graphical object based on that data

- ex. d3.svg.line and d3.svg.area

#Components
- Chart components for example... d3.svg.axis, which creates a bunch of <line>, <path>, <g> and <text> elements that are needed for an axis based on the scale and settings you provide the function

- d3.svg.brush
